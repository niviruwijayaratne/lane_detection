# Autonomous Lane Detection
This project was a deep dive into Autonomous Driving and its computer vision applications. I gained a lot of OpenCV experience and picked up some computer vision theory along the way. The video for this project was taken with my unsteady hand on a bumpy road with my phone so with proper mounted cameras results could be much better :)

## TO-DO
- Finish building models
- Make lane detection algorithm more robust for lane changes/passing cars/more crowded scenes
- Look into real time estimation of parameters for perspective transformation (is this adjustment even neccesarsy or is this just a hyperparameters that can be tuned and will stay constant???)
