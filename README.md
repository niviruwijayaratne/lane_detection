# Autonomous Lane Detection


## Demo

This project was a deep dive into Autonomous Driving and its computer vision applications. I gained a lot of OpenCV experience and picked up some computer vision theory.

## TO-DO
- Implement YOLO for car detection
- Make more robust for lane changes and passing cars
- Instead of YOLO potentially implement some segmentation model
