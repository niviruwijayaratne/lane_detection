# Autonomous Lane Detection
This project was a deep dive into Autonomous Driving and its computer vision applications. I gained a lot of OpenCV experience and picked up some computer vision theory along the way. The video for this project was taken with my unsteady hand on a bumpy road with my phone so with proper mounted cameras results could be much better :)

## TO-DO
- Implement YOLO for car detection
- Make more robust for lane changes and passing cars
- Instead of YOLO potentially implement some segmentation model
